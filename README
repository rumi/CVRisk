LANGUAGE
========
The project is a Flex Builder 4 project. To compile, download the distribution and create a new Flex Web Project 
using the distribution folder as the project folder. The sources may also be compiled using the free Adobe FLEX SDK from
http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/entitlement/index.cfm?e=flex4sdk

If you have compilation problems, open Project Properties and check that
(1) locale/en_US is declared as an extra source folder
(2) Pathnames are correct - the distribution was built on a Mac/Unix filestore and some adjustments may be necessary for Windows.

SAMPLE FILES
============
The src folder contains a number of sample xml files which may be loaded into the Profile screen.

USAGE
=====
Launch the animation in a web browser. On the Profile screen, fill in your personal data. 
You may save your personal data to your local disk for later use. Once valid data is available
on the Profile screen, the output screens will be enabled.
