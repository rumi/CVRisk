Installing CVRisk
=================

Download a disribution from github.com/rumi and move the unarchived distribution to a Flex Builder 4 
workspace directory. In FB4, create a new Flex Prok=ject for the web, giving CVRisk as the name of
the project and selecting the downloaded distribution as the project folder.

You may need to adjust the project file to achieve a clean compiltion.
